NOTE : 

The WAV file is a decompressed version of the MP3 file, for the MP3 is 
the only source that I still have. For creating derivatives of the 
audio, please use the WAV to prevent further quality losses and try
not to touch the MP3. MP3 is a lossy format, but as I already said, 
I don't have a lossless version of this song anymore.
