The song is composed and sung 2006 by "mikadoklaus" ( I don't know the
real name ) and I have the rights to publish it under the license of 
my own choice, so I also publish it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License  as published by the Free Software Foundation,

Because of some data loss, the MP3 file in src/ folder and the lyrics are 
the only sources that I still have. Please try not to touch the MP3 in src/ 
to prevent any unneccessarily quality loss - the WAV file also located there
is an uncompressed version of the MP3 file.
